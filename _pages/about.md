I am a PHP developer based in Dublin. I have started my career in software development back in 2009.

More than 4 years I was a part of Magento team, participating in Magento 1, Magento 2 and Magento Testing Framework development. 

Last several years I work on Magento 2 customization and extensions development as a full stack web developer.
