Hi there! My name is Sergii Ivashchenko. I am a software engineer from Ukraine based in Ireland, a member of Magento Community Engineering team. 

I have a versatile experience that includes participating in Magento 2 development from the early beginnings, performing award-winning Magento 1 to Magento 2 migrations, developing over 80 extensions and integrations, and publishing video courses for Magento 2 developers.

Currently, working on the Open Source & Partners Contribution Program, I help developers to do quality contributions to Magento codebase and deliver them to the mainline.
