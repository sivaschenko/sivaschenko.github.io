## Prehistory

The idea of Dublin Magento Developers Meetup came up at the [Magento Meetup Ireland 16](https://www.meetup.com/Magento-Meetup-Ireland/events/234496984/) that happend 26th October 2016.

That was a result of Magento community willing to have more frequent and more technical meetups, the brilliant [technical presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/GordonKnoppe/tips-and-best-practices-for-developing-on-magento-2) by [Gordon Knoppe](https://twitter.com/gordonknoppe) following by a quart of Guiness and active communication at Ashtons. :)

Having support of the idea from developers present at the meetup, we together with [Paras Sood](https://twitter.com/ParasSood29) decided to create a poll and see if Magento Developers in Ireland are interested in such meetups. And it appeared they are!

To encourage developer participation and cover the most actual topics Stephen Kenealy proposed to use 'unconference' format for the meetup.

## The Meetup

The first Magento Developers Ireland Meetup took place January 16, 2017 in Dublin at Monsoon Consulting office.

First, we had a great presentation explaining the details of Magento 2 Checkout implementation by [Max Pronko](https://twitter.com/max_pronko):

Max's presentation disclosed the depth of complex Magento 2 Checkout functionality implementation.

After the presentation we had lots of exiting discussions about Magento 2 projects, compexity, estimation, pros and cons of the marketlace at the round table.

## Conclusion

For me this meetup was an awesome new way to shift focus from only presentations to open discussion where everyone is involved.

Although the meetup was named "Dev", it just means that it is focused to technical topics. So designers, project managers, e-commerce marketeers, quality assurance and other Magento folks are more then welcome at the meetup to have a more holistic discussion around Magento.

We also come to a conclusion that it would be a good idea to organize some hackathons to get not only technical but practical benefits from the event and help bring Ireland's Magento community on the map of actively contributing Magento communities in the world!
